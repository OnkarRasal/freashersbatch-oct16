HINT:- look for commands -> locate, find and whereis

Big difference is that find searches real files recursively down a given directory, while locate searches a database without requiring specific directory.
 Thus, if you have saved a file before updating database, find will find it , but locate won't
 
62.How Globbing is different from locate, find and whereis?
Big difference is that find searches real files recursively down a given directory, while locate searches a database without requiring specific directory. 
Thus, if you have saved a file before updating database, find will find it , but locate won't

63.Explain the Linux File System.
A Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition. A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data. In our machine, there can be various partitions of the memory. Generally, every partition contains a file system.
The general-purpose computer system needs to store data systematically so that we can easily access the files in less time. It stores the data on hard disks (HDD) or some equivalent storage type. There may be below reasons for maintaining the file system:

64.Explain absolute and Relative Paths
Absolute path refers to the same location in a file system relative to the root directory,
